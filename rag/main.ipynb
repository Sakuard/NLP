      "3. Habitat: Llamas, vicuñas, and camels are all found in the Andean region of South America, where they inhabit high-altitude grasslands and deserts.\n",
      "4. Social behavior: These animals are social creatures and often live in herds. They communicate with each other through a variety of vocalizations, including grunts, bleats, and whistles.\n",
      "5. Reproduction: Llamas, vicuñas, and camels all have a similar reproductive cycle, involving a gestation period of around 11-12 months and a litter size of one or two offspring.\n",
